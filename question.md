- Section 2.1.2 Implementation of detecting overflow for int16_t: is this background?
- maybe not mention double and int52 at all?
- floating point exception, is this background?
- also i can talk about scalar integer overflow detection instruction `seto` 
- background -> google benchmark: Arjun says this is too much detail
- background -> llvm-mca: the requirement says I should not do a journal, and llvm-mca did not work for me. should i still talk about it? 

- section 3.1 Vectorization method: rewrite, focus on clang cannot vectorized complicated operations
