## Questions 

- maybe not mention double and int52 at all?
- background -> google benchmark: Arjun says this is too much detail
- background -> llvm-mca: the requirement says I should not do a journal, and llvm-mca did not work for me. should i still talk about it? 

- Clang use xmm vector vector instructions for scalar operation in a zmm chunk,
  why? maybe flush pipeline when interleaving between vector and scalar? i did
  not find any source or explanation

- integrate into mlir?
- talk about int16 in abstract and introduction?

<!-- - a related work section? -->
<!-- extend the usage of presburger library -->

## Notes
- Note: my current fastest impl with float is ~25 ns using ymm, for col 24
- TODO: make a list of contributions in introduction
- "extensive knowledge" of literature 
- use `~` for cites 
- TODO: fix citation
- TODO: fix number
- TODO: fix plot
